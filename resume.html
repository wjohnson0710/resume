    <h2>AutoBiography</h2>
    <p class="autobio">
        My name is William Johnson. I was born in Tampa Florida in February of 1995. I come from a simple background. My grandparents were teachers. My father was a truck driver and my mother was a pharmacy technician. While I was fortunate enough to have both my parents around, I grew up in very harsh and poor conditions. Where we lived in Tampa was as some would say, "the wrong side of the tracks". I wasn't allowed outside a lot due to the conditions of our enviroment. This meant I spent a lot of time in doors playing games. This is where my passion for computers came from. I did not have the means to go to college when I graduated highschool so I started working. I often worked odd end blue collar mechanics jobs until I landed what I thought would be my dream job at Audi. I pursued this for many years but I still had that insatiable thirst for computers. I started teaching myself how to code python thanks to some books and youtube. I saved up enough money to do a software engineering bootcamp through the University of South Florida. Which brings us to where we are in present day. To showcase some of the things I have learned, I decided to make this HTML/CSS resume in hopes of grabbing someones eye to take a chance on a kid from the "wrong side of the tracks".
